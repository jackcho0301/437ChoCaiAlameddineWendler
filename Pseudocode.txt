RETRIEVE PORTFOLIO INFO (PSEUDOCODE)
Use the user ID and and Portfolio number to retrieve the Portfolio
Return a list of all Stock Names/Number of Units/Initial Cost Per Unit documents from the Portfolio


RETRIEVE CURRENT INFO (PSEUDOCODE)
Use the user ID and and Portfolio number to retrieve the Portfolio
Retrieve a list of all Stock Names/Number of Units/Initial Cost Per Unit documents from the Portfolio
Use the Stock Names to retrieve Current Cost (i.e. Price) from API of each Stock Name
Return the Stock Names/Current Cost


COI (Cost of Investment) ALGORITHM (PSEUDOCODE)
Run RETRIEVE PORTFOLIO INFO

// Calculate the Cost of Investment
Set COI to 0
For each Stock Name
	Multiply Number of Units by Initial Cost
	Add to COI
Return COI


TOTAL RETURN ALGORITHM (PSEUDOCODE)
Run COI ALGORITHM to get COI
Run RETRIEVE CURRENT INFO

// Calculate the Initial Value
Set IV to COI
// Fairly simple...the only way this will get more complicated is if we add things like trading commissions, which might be a way to penalize users trading too much...

// Calculate the Final Value
Set FV to 0
For each Stock Name
	Multiply Number of Units by Current Cost
	Add to FV
// Again, fairly simple...but this would get more complicated if we added things like dividends

// Calculate the Net Value
Set NV to FV - IV
Return NV


RETURN ALGORITHM (PSEUDOCODE)
Use the user ID and and Portfolio number to retrieve the Portfolio
Retrieve a list of all Stock Names/Number of Units/Initial Cost Per Unit documents from the Portfolio
Use the Stock Names to retrieve Current Cost (i.e. Price) from API of each Stock Name

Set Return Collection to Empty
For each Stock Name
	Multply Number of Units by Current Cost to get Return

Return Return Collection


HOLDING ALGORITHM (PSEUDOCODE)
Use the user ID and and Portfolio number to retrieve the Portfolio
Retrieve a list of all Stock Names/Number of Units/Initial Cost Per Unit documents from the Portfolio
Use the Stock Names to retrieve Current Cost (i.e. Price) from API of each Stock Name

Run TOTAL RETURN ALGORITHM to get Total Value

Set Holding Collection to Empty
For each Stock Name
	Multply Number of Units by Current Cost to get Return
	Divide Return by Total Value to get Holding
	Add Stock Name/Holding to Holding Collection
Return Holding Collection


ROI ALGORITHM (PSEUDOCODE)
Run TOTAL RETURN ALGORITHM to get TR
Run COI ALGORITHM to get COI

// Calculate the ROI as Percentage
Divide TR by COI
Multiply by 100 to get ROI
Return ROI
